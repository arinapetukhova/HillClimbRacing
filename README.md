# Hill Climb Racing Optimization

**Course Project — Nature Inspired Computing (Spring 2025)**  
Authors: Lev Permyakov, Arina Petukhova, Alelia Turushkina — Group DS-02

## Overview

This project explores the application of Nature-Inspired Computing (NIC) techniques to enhance the gameplay mechanics and AI behavior in the popular mobile game "Hill Climb Racing". By using Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Gray Wolf Inspired Algorithm, we aimed to improve vehicle control, terrain adaptability, and opponent AI. Our findings demonstrate that NIC can enhance gameplay by introducing adaptive learning mechanisms.

The main goal is to compare the effectiveness of the following algorithms:

- Genetic Algorithm
- Gray Wolf Optimization
- Particle Swarm Optimization

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate directory:

- `GeneticAlgorithm/`
- `GrayWolf/`
- `ParticleSwarmOptimization/`

A detailed description and analysis of the results are provided in the `ProjectReport.pdf` file.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML

## Project Structure

- `GeneticAlgorithm/` — Genetic Algorithm implementation
- `GrayWolf/` — Gray Wolf Inspired Algorithm implementation
- `ParticleSwarmOptimization/` — Particle Swarm Optimization implementation
- `ProjectReport.pdf` — Project report with description, analysis and conclusions
