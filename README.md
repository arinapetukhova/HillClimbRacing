# Nature Inspired Computing (Spring 2025). Hill Climb Racing
The project aims to explore the application of Nature Inspired Computing techniques
to enhance the gameplay mechanics and AI behavior in the popular mobile game
"Hill Climb Racing." By leveraging algorithms inspired by natural processes, such as genetic algorithms, we aim to create more
dynamic and adaptive gameplay experiences. This will involve optimizing vehicle
physics and improving AI strategies.
